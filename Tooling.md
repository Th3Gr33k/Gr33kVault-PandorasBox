### **1. MA\astering ADVANCE Pentesting classes**
- **Advanced Evasion Techniques:** Bypassing AV, EDR, and network defenses.
- **Windows & Linux Post-Exploitation:** Living off the land, persistence, and privilege escalation.
- **Covert C2 (Command & Control):** Custom backdoors, encrypted comms, and payload delivery.
- **Active Directory Exploitation:** Kerberos abuse, lateral movement, and AD misconfigurations.
- **OPSEC Considerations:** Staying undetected while operating in a network.

### **2. Tools**

#### **(1) Custom Shellcode Loader (AV/EDR Evasion)**
- A small C++ or C# tool to **execute shellcode in memory** without being flagged.
- We can use **syscalls, process injection, or reflective DLL loading**.

#### **(2) Process Injection & Defense Evasion Tool**
- Inject payloads into legitimate processes (like `explorer.exe`).
- Test **thread hijacking, APC injection, and direct syscalls**.

#### **(3) Encrypted C2 Channel (Covert Communication)**
- Create a lightweight **Python or Golang** C2 that evades detection.
- Use **TLS, DNS tunneling, or covert HTTP traffic** to bypass firewalls.

#### **(4) Active Directory Attack Automation**
- A **Python or PowerShell script** to automate AD enumeration.
- Implement **Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, and Pass-the-Hash attacks**.

#### **(5) Custom Dropper with XOR Encoding**
- Build a **custom dropper** that encodes payloads with XOR or AES to evade detection.
- Implement **sandbox evasion techniques**.

### **3. Learning & Practice Strategy**
- **Hands-On Lab:** Set up a Windows & AD lab with detections enabled to test evasion.
- **Custom Offensive Security Toolkit:** Build and refine your own hacking tools.
- **Review OPSEC Failures:** Learn from **how attackers get caught** and avoid common mistakes.
